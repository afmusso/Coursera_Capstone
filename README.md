## 1. Introduction/Business Problem

In Seattle exists a lot of accidents by year. That include a various collision types, in different localization of the city, people involved, transport modes, datetime, etc.
We need to understand which variables influence in accidents so we can take actions. For example, a certain intersection can present a lot of accidents with a lot of mortality, so we can advertising to modify it.
For these reason we want to predict the severity of a collision. The objective of that, is to know how affect a new street (or an old modified), in the accidents so we can decrease the mortal accidents.

It will be used a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm to do that. In specific i'll use classification models like K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression. With that, i'll choose that present the best index parameters.

## 2. Data

I'll work with certain columns of the dataset. The serveritycode (the dependent variable). Also, with coords we can construct a map of how the distribution severity on the city (that also traduces in ADDRTYPE of the point). Also I'll construct and histogram by day, because the behaviour of the people change if is a day of the week or a weekend. Other information can help, like if a parked car is involved, cross walk, speeding, etc.
